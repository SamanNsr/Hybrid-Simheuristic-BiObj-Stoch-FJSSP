# Hybrid-Simheuristic-BiObj-Stoch-FJSSP

This repository contains the source code and dataset associated with the research paper "A Hybrid Simheuristic Algorithm for Solving Bi-Objective Stochastic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems".

## Installation

This project uses Python and manages dependencies through Poetry. To set up the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Poetry for Python dependency management

### Setting Up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamanNsr/Hybrid-Simheuristic-BiObj-Stoch-FJSSP.git
cd Hybrid-Simheuristic-BiObj-Stoch-FJSSP
poetry install
```

## Code

The included code primarily serves as a foundational problem module, demonstrating the core structure and functionality required to tackle the bi-objective stochastic flexible job shop scheduling problem outlined in our paper. While the specific metaheuristic algorithm used in our research is not provided directly within this repository, the design is modular, allowing for seamless integration with any metaheuristic framework or custom solution you may develop.

## Dataset

The dataset included in this repository is used for testing and validating the algorithm. It consists of various job shop scheduling scenarios with stochastic elements. Data details and usage instructions are provided in the `dataset/` directory.
